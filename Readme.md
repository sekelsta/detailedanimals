Modifies [Vintage Story](https://www.vintagestory.at/).

This repository contains two projects:
* Genelib, a library modders can use to add genetics and other animal-related features with mainly json
* [Truth and Beauty: Detailed Animals](https://mods.vintagestory.at/detailedanimals), a mod improving on animal husbandry, behavior, and genetics.

In general, the difference is that anything actually changing how the game works goes in Detailed Animals, while anything modders may want to use to do similar things in a different project goes in Genelib. The one exception where Genelib does modify the game directly is the nestbox, which is changed out to allow eggs to carry genetic information.

## Genelib
**API still unstable until a 1.0 release!**

The basic idea:
* You write a json file describing what genes and alleles exist, and how likely an animal is to have them
* Genelib handles the backend parts: Initializing and storing gene data for entities, and children inheriting genes from parents
* Genelib provides a few simple gene-based effects
* You will need to write code for more complicated effects like coat color genetics

Genelib also contains the code responsible for the nutrition system you see in Detailed Animals, and in fact that nutrition ties into breeding.

### Genetics features
Supports Mendelian genetics, sex-linked genes for both mammals (XY) and birds (ZW), and haplodiploidy such as in bees. Genetic linkage is planned but not in yet. Each gene can have up to 256 alleles.

Not planned: Lateral gene transfer, chromosome rearrangement, polyploidy.

### GenomeType
The GenomeType is where you provide data in json format. You need one GenomeType per hybridizable group - so for example horses and donkeys should share the same GenomeType so that they can hybridize. This is usually going to end up meaning one GenomeType per genus, rather than species or family. Animals will not be able to hybridize unless they have the same GenomeType.

This should be a json file with 3 parts:
* "genes": A list of all possible genes and alleles for all combined species using this genome type
* "interpreters": A list of C# classes that figure out what the different gene variants actually mean. "Polygenes" provides the basic built-in functionality. If you write a custom gene interpreter, this is where you link it in.
* "initializers": Set up the probability that an animal starts with specific gene variants when spawned. You can have multiple different initializers, and each one should correspond to a population (as in the biology concept) such as a subspecies, landrace, or breed. You can also add environmental conditions, for example to make a white coat color more common in artic areas.

GenomeType files go in assets/\[modid]/genetics/\[mygenometype].json

Notes on setting up the gene list:

Though you should provide the genes and alleles as nice readable strings, for performance reasons Genelib will internally store them as numbers based on their ordering. So, DO NOT reorder your genes and alleles, or it will break existing save files. Renaming them is ok though.

Avoid naming any alleles "default", because the gene initializer uses that as a keyword.

When the mod is first installed, or when new genes are added, existing entities are assumed to have the _first_ allele listed. If it doesn't have any more specific name, I recommend calling the first allele "wildtype" if it is the wildtype, or otherwise calling it "standard".

You cannot have more than 256 alleles for a single gene.

### Gene Interpreters
A gene interpreter is a C# class that calculates a phenotype based on a genotype. In other words, it looks at what genes an individual animal has and figures out what that animal should look like, how much health or other stats it should have, what it drops when killed, its temperament, or anything else that you care to have genes affect.

To make a gene interpreter, you should write a class implementing the GeneInterpreter interface. See its source code for info on implementing the methods. You will then need to register your gene interpreter class by calling GenomeType.RegisterInterpreter(codename, instance). The codename is the same string you'll use to refer to it from the GenomeType json file.

One interpreter is built-in, the Polygenes interpreter. This provides basic effects, currently just having fertility decrease for inbred animals. It also calculates a probabilistic COI (coefficient of inbreeding), but doesn't do anything with it except write to the entity's WatchedAttributes.

### Entity Behaviors and AI tasks
To get genetics to work right, you will have to add a few specific EntityBehaviors to your entity. By code, they are:

"genelib.genetics": For having genes, what a shocker. Specify "genomeType" here. Serverside only.

"genelib.age" replacing "grow": Makes baby animals keep their genes when they grow up. Main effects are serverside, and that is where you'll need to put info about how long it takes to grow up and such. Also add to the clientside to make animals visibly change size with growth, but there you don't need any data beyond the behavior code.

"genelib.reproduce" replacing "multiply": Allows the entity to create offspring who inherit genes from both parents. Again the main affects are serverside, that's where the data goes, and clientside you just need it to show the player the info text.

If your entity lays eggs, add the AI task "genelib.layegg" which will make its eggs carry genetic information (provided they are laid into a genelib:nestbox). Also add a list of layable egg types to the entity's attributes (a list with only one item is fine), or it will default to chicken eggs. Make sure the egg perish time is longer than the incubation length or the eggs will rot before chicks can hatch.

Aside from EntityBehaviors, if you have any sex-linked genes you should also add male:true/false to the entity's attributes to specify, for example, that roosters are male and hens are female. For convenience, if you leave this out it will take a guess based on the entity code + variant groups - if the whole thing contains the string "-female" it will be treated as female, otherwise as male.

Now, genelib.reproduce does not only make it so genes are passed down, but also changes the way that breeding depends on food in order to go with the nutrition system. So to make that work properly, also add:

"genelib.hunger": Causes the animal to keep track of nutrition and get hungry over time. You *must* include this in the behaviorConfigs. You then may leave it out of the regular client and server behavior lists, as custom loading code will add it in for you. Under the hood, this also triggers a replacement of "harvestable" with "genelib.harvestable".

AI task "genelib.forage", which ensures foods eaten are processed by the nutrition system

For complete examples of how to set up genetics and other features Genelib offers, see Detailed Animals in this same repository.
